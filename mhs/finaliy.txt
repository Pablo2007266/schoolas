<h2>Introduction</h2><p>

Mahbert High School, a premier Christian co-educational public instituition was established in the year 1967 by Late Mr. C. Mahbert, son of Mr. George Mahbert, Rai Shaib, MLA and first Chairman (Siliguri Municipality) and his wife Late Mrs A. Mahbert. The Oldest and first public English School in Siliguri.The name “Mahbert” is now synonymous with quality education and aims at providing academic and vocational training to children irrespective of their religious, social or cultural background.

Late Mr. C. Mahbert was a determined yet kind and sensitive man. A visionary who foresaw the need for a good school, and laid the basis for the present day establishment, which now imparts education to over fifteen hundred students. After his sad demise on the 2nd December 1974 (now commemorated as “Memorial Day”), the responsibility of furthering the ideals of Mr. C. Mahbert was taken up by Late Mrs. A.
